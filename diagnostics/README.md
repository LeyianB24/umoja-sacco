# Diagnostics & Temporary Scripts

This directory is for temporary scripts, one-off diagnostics, and audit tools generated during development.
Files here should not be deployed to production.

## Usage
- Place all `test_*.php`, `audit_*.php`, and `debug_*.php` files here.
- Ensure they require `../config/app_config.php` correctly (adjust paths by one level).
